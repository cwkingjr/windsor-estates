## Businesses In Windsor Estates

Our Community FB Group doesn't allow advertising but we have some businesses that operate from the neighborhood or are owned by folks that live in the neighborhood, so I decided to list some of them here. These are not recommendations by me unless I explicity say as much here. Basically, the listing will be here so folks that live in our neighborhood that want to support others from the neighborhood can find the links. They are wholely on their own to evaluation the attributes of the business and choose it or not.

## Honorable Mention

- Pressure Washing. I have not done business with this guy, but I stopped and talked to him for a bit while he was doing an estimate for house washing in the neighborhood. I'm posting this here because I was extremely impressed with the young man himself. He was super nice, super professional, super knowlegable, and kind enough to take the time to answer some rando questions on the side of the road. His equipment looked professional also and I hope he is very successful. I don't even really know him, but he left a stellar impression. https://magictouchpressurewash.com/
